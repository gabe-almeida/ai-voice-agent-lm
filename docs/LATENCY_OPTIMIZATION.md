# Voice Agent Latency Optimization Guide

## Current Latency Issues

The original implementation has significant delays because:

1. **Sequential Processing**: Wait for complete text → Generate complete audio → Play audio
2. **Large Audio Generation**: Generating audio for entire responses takes 5-8 seconds
3. **No Streaming**: Users wait for the entire process to complete before hearing anything

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Streaming Text-to-Speech Service

**File**: `src/services/streaming-tts.service.ts`

This service breaks text into smaller chunks and generates audio progressively:

```typescript
// Splits text on natural boundaries (sentences, phrases)
const DEFAULT_CHUNK_DELIMITER = /[.!?;,]\s+|\n/;

// Smaller chunks = faster initial response
maxChunkSize: 80 characters
```

**Benefits**:
- First audio plays within 1-2 seconds instead of 5-8 seconds
- Natural speech flow with pauses at sentence boundaries
- Continues generating while playing earlier chunks

### 2. Server-Sent Events (SSE) for Streaming

**File**: `src/routes/chat-streaming.routes.ts`

Uses SSE to stream both text and audio chunks to the client:

```javascript
// Send text immediately when available
res.write(`event: text\ndata: ${JSON.stringify({ text })}\n\n`);

// Stream audio chunks as they're generated
res.write(`event: audio\ndata: ${JSON.stringify({ audio, chunkIndex })}\n\n`);
```

**Benefits**:
- Client receives text immediately (< 1 second)
- Audio chunks arrive progressively
- No need for WebSockets complexity

### 3. Audio Queue Management

**File**: `public/streaming-chat.html`

Client-side audio queue for seamless playback:

```javascript
// Queue audio chunks
audioQueue.push({ base64Audio, isLast });

// Play chunks sequentially
async function playNextAudio() {
    const { base64Audio } = audioQueue.shift();
    const audio = new Audio(audioUrl);
    audio.onended = () => playNextAudio();
    await audio.play();
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Smooth playback without gaps
- Handles network jitter
- Continues playing while receiving new chunks

## Performance Metrics

### Before Optimization:
- **Text Response**: 1-2 seconds
- **Audio Generation**: 5-8 seconds
- **Total Time to First Audio**: 6-10 seconds

### After Optimization:
- **Text Response**: 1-2 seconds (unchanged)
- **First Audio Chunk**: 1-2 seconds
- **Complete Audio**: 3-5 seconds (overlapped with playback)

## Further Optimizations

### 1. Implement Partial Text Streaming

Currently waiting for complete text response. Could stream text as it's generated:

```typescript
// Use Gemini streaming API
const stream = await model.generateContentStream(prompt);
for await (const chunk of stream) {
    // Send partial text immediately
}
```

### 2. Pre-generate Common Phrases

Cache audio for common responses:

```typescript
const commonPhrases = {
    'greeting': 'Hi there! How can I help you today?',
    'goodbye': 'Thank you for calling. Have a great day!'
};
```

### 3. Use WebRTC for Real-time Audio

Replace HTTP streaming with WebRTC for lower latency:

```typescript
// Establish WebRTC connection
const pc = new RTCPeerConnection();
const audioTrack = new MediaStreamTrack();
```

### 4. Optimize Chunk Sizes Dynamically

Adjust chunk size based on network conditions:

```typescript
// Start with small chunks for fast initial response
let chunkSize = 50;

// Increase size if network is fast
if (generationTime < 500) {
    chunkSize = Math.min(chunkSize + 20, 150);
}
```

### 5. Parallel Processing

Generate multiple chunks in parallel:

```typescript
// Process chunks concurrently
const chunkPromises = chunks.map(chunk => 
    ttsService.textToSpeech(chunk)
);
const audioBuffers = await Promise.all(chunkPromises);
```

## Testing the Optimizations

### 1. Access the Streaming Interface

Open: `http://localhost:3000/streaming-chat.html`

### 2. Monitor Latency Metrics

The interface displays:
- **Text Latency**: Time to receive text response
- **First Audio**: Time to first audio chunk
- **Total**: Complete response time

### 3. Compare with Original

Original interface: `http://localhost:3000/index.html`
- Notice the delay before audio starts playing
- Compare the time to first sound

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Initial Chunks Small**: 50-80 characters for fastest response
2. **Split on Natural Boundaries**: Sentences and phrases for natural flow
3. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Continue with next chunk if one fails
4. **Monitor Queue Size**: Prevent memory issues with large responses
5. **Test Network Conditions**: Ensure it works on slower connections

## Integration with Twilio

To use streaming with Twilio calls:

1. Use Twilio Media Streams for real-time audio
2. Implement WebSocket connection for bidirectional streaming
3. Convert audio formats (μ-law ↔ PCM)
4. Handle packet loss and jitter

```typescript
// Twilio Media Stream webhook
app.post('/webhooks/twilio/mediastream', (ws) => {
    ws.on('message', (msg) => {
        const data = JSON.parse(msg);
        if (data.event === 'media') {
            // Process incoming audio
            processAudioChunk(data.media.payload);
        }
    });
});
```

## Conclusion

The streaming implementation significantly improves the user experience by:

1. **Reducing perceived latency** from 6-10 seconds to 1-2 seconds
2. **Creating natural conversation flow** with progressive audio
3. **Improving scalability** by processing smaller chunks

This makes the voice agent feel more like a natural phone conversation rather than a slow chatbot.
